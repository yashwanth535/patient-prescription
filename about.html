  <h5>Dispensary Management involved many functional systems which are distributed in the multiple departments, sub-systems and sub-process and depends on each other
      for various types of data information, authentication and reports to take further actions. These departments also located at multi buildings & locations. So the m
      anual system is quite hectic, complex, which involves more manpower, time consuming to operate manually and also increases the chances of life risk for the patient just
      not the availability of important data information on time. The system creates risks when there are urgent needs of some data information & reports of the patient to decide
      the line of treatment and to take a course of action on an immediate basis to save the life of the patient.</br>
      </br></br>
      Considering the large no. of patient’s data, to maintain history of the patient, manpower involved to operate, multi locations & department’s involvement, the treatment suggested
